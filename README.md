# TV Timer+

TV Timer+ helps you manage your TV with a simple countdown timer that automatically puts your device to sleep.
Perfect for Android TV based devices and set-top boxes, it’s the easiest way to prevent late-night streaming or manage children’s screen time.

## ⚙️ How it works

TV Timer+ communicates directly with your device through the built-in local ADB service on Android TV.
This allows the app to send secure commands that manage TV functions — such as sleep mode today, and more parental control options in future updates.

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ **Preset timer selection** – quickly choose a preset duration.
- ⏳ **Countdown timer** – puts the TV to sleep automatically when finished.
- 🔒 **Completely local** – no internet connection required.

## 🛠️ Roadmap

Planned features for future releases:
- 📡 **Local network remote control** (bundled server).
- ✅ **Allow-list for apps** – restrict which apps can run when the timer is active.
- ⏰ **Custom timer durations** – add your own time intervals.
- 🛑 **More actions than sleep** – additional options once the timer ends.
