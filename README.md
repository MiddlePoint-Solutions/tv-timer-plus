# 📺 TV Timer+

TV Timer+ is an open-source AndroidTV application that helps you automatically put your TV to sleep after a set time.  
It works by using the local **ADB server** on Android TV to send sleep commands when the countdown timer ends.

This makes it perfect for:
- **Auto sleep in the evening** (so the TV won’t stay on overnight).
- **Parental control** to help manage children’s screen time.

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ **Preset timer selection** – quickly choose a preset duration.
- ⏳ **Countdown timer** – puts the TV to sleep automatically when finished.
- 🔒 **Completely local** – no internet connection required.

## 🛠️ Roadmap

Planned features for future releases:
- 📡 **Local network remote control** (bundled server).
- ✅ **Allow-list for apps** – restrict which apps can run when the timer is active.
- ⏰ **Custom timer durations** – add your own time intervals.
- 🛑 **More actions than sleep** – additional options once the timer ends.
